# Drake Jupyter Examples
This repository contains example notebooks that show how to use some of the features of [Drake](http://drake.mit.edu/) in [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks.

## Pre-requisites
The notebooks in this repository assume that you've installed Drake (binary installation instructions can be found [here](http://drake.mit.edu/from_binary.html)) and added `<drake-install-location>/lib/python2.7/site-packages` to your `PYTHONPATH`. In order to see the 3D visualizations, you'll need to launch `<drake-install-location>/bin/drake-visualizer`.
